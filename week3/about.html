    <p id="words">Please enjoy a picture I took on a hiking adventure in Paradise Valley, Montana! I am not 
        feeling creative tonight. Rather the anxiety of possibly having late assignments with the errors I was 
        having disrupted the normal flow. Althought my logic and reasoning has been kicked into gear I am 
        utterly exhausted, however I will prevail and make the best of what I can until I get everything correct!
        I miss living in Montana, the hiking trips were some of the most inspiring <span id="blank">(for lack of better word)</span> places to be! I used to write stories whenever I would go hiking that I thought one day I would compile into an actual book. The ideas for it left me when I moved away from the state.</p>
