                    Welcome to My lovely creations page! I am a person with many varying interest, However this page will sever as my outlet for my 
                    crochet creations! I started crocheting when I was 14, However I did not get super invested not creative with it until I was 
                    roughly 19 years old! My first attempt at amigurumi was an adorable little turtle! Since than I have taken my skills to an 
                    entirely new level, making smaller items and more detailed items as well! Here we will explore different patterns, ones that:    
                </article>
                <ul class="mainList">
                    <li>I have tested personally</li>
                    <li>Turned out super cute</li>
                    <li>Did not look like they should have</li>
                    <li>Trouble shooting random questions</li>
                    <li>Sharing tips and tricks</li>
                </ul>
                <article>
                and so much more! Everyone starts at the beginning, and we all need practice to make what we want to make! I remember when I first started I had some goofy looking creations that I, at the time, felt ashamed of. Now I look back and giggle at my mistakes and recall all the fun I had making all of the stuffed animals, booties and hats! I look forward to our journey together and I hope you all enjoy this page! Please link all shared sources to patterns you are sharing so that proper credit is given where it should be. I will also note creations that are entirely free handed!
