                <p id="date">June 13th 2017</p><br>This adventure was a very interesting one indeed, beartooth trail is aptly named. Upon entering the hiking trail we passed this area and there were a few small animal prints however nothing truly alarming. We continually heard sounds while hiking up the trail, when a storm started to roll in we decided to head back. On the way down we found bear prints and I had to get a picture. How long after we passed this area did the bear pass us by? Scary and fun all in one! <a id="readmore"> read more..</a>
